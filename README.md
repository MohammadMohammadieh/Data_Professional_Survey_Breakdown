# Data_Professional_Survey_Breakdown
In the data professional survey analysis project, I utilized the power of Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of survey data targeting individuals in the data and analytics field. The project's primary aim was to extract valuable insights from the survey responses, enabling a deeper understanding of trends, preferences, and challenges faced by data professionals.
To achieve this, I first cleaned my extensive Excel dataset by removing all unnecessary data. Then, I imported the cleaned data into Power BI where i began to create and design several charts. These were later combined on a fully dynamic dashboard that summarizes the conclusions drawn and can be customized to the user's preferences.
